Your task is to build an efficient product search API using Django and PostgreSQL. Our product database includes thousands of items with names, brands, categories, and nutrition facts. Users often search with partial keywords, misspellings, or mixed languages (English/Arabic). We want a smart, fast, and relevant search experience.


Apply solution that will be the best among others on these criteria:
